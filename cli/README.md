# DIDKit CLI

DIDKit offers its functionality in a command-line program, `didkit`.

## Build

```sh
$ cargo build
```

## Install
```sh
$ cargo install --path .
```

## Commands

### `didkit help`

Output help about `didkit` and its subcommands.

### `didkit generate-ed25519-key`

Generate a Ed25519 keypair and output it in [JWK format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037#appendix-A.1).

### `didkit key-to-did <method_name>`

Given a [JWK][] and a DID method name, output the corresponding DID.

Currently, this only supports [Ed25519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037#appendix-A.2) keys, [did:key][] and [did:web][].

### `didkit key-to-verification-method <method_name>`

Given a Ed25519 [JWK][] and a supported DID method name, output the corresponding [verificationMethod][].

#### Options

- `-k, --key-path <file>` (required, conflicts with jwk) - Filename of JWK file
- `-j, --jwk <jwk>` (required, conflicts with key-path) - JWK.

### `didkit vc-issue-credential`

Issue a verifiable credential. Reads credential on stdin, constructs a [linked data proof][ld-proofs] to add to the credential, and outputs the resulting verifiable credential.

Corresponds to [/credentials/issue](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/#operation/issueCredential) in [vc-http-api][].

The proof type is set automatically based on the key file provided. JWK parameters besides the cryptographic components, such as [kid][] (Key ID), are ignored currently. For an RSA key, the [alg][] (Algorithm) parameter is ignored and `RS256` is used for it, for [RsaSignature2018][].

#### Options

- `-r, --did-resolver <url>` - [DID resolver HTTP(S) endpoint][did-resolution-https-binding], used for DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing for non-built-in DID Methods. Equivalent to environmental variable `DID_RESOLVER`.
- `-k, --key-path <key>` (required, conflicts with jwk) - Filename of JWK for signing.

The following options correspond to linked data [proof options][] as specified in [ld-proofs][] and [vc-http-api][]:

- `-C, --challenge <challenge>` - [challenge][] property of the proof
- `-c, --created <created>` - [created][] property of the proof. ISO8601 datetime. Defaults to the current time.
  time.
- `-d, --domain <domain>` - [domain][] property of the proof
- `-j, --jwk <jwk>` (required, conflicts with key-path) - JWK for signing.
- `-p, --proof-purpose <proof-purpose>` [proofPurpose][] property of the proof.
- `-v, --verification-method <verification-method>` [verificationMethod][]
  property of the proof. URI for proof verification information, e.g. a public key identifier.

#### Supported [JWK key types][kty]

- `RSA`
- `OKP` (`curve`: `Ed25519`)

### `didkit vc-verify-credential`

Verify a verifiable credential. Reads verifiable credential on standard input, and outputs verification result. Returns exit status zero if credential successfully verified, or non-zero if errors were encountered.

Corresponds to [/credentials/verify](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/#operation/verifyCredential) in [vc-http-api][].

#### Options

- `-r, --did-resolver <url>` - [DID resolver HTTP(S) endpoint][did-resolution-https-binding], used for DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing for non-built-in DID Methods. Equivalent to environmental variable `DID_RESOLVER`.

The following options are linked data [proof options][] as specified in [ld-proofs][] and [vc-http-api][]. If there is more than one proof present, at least one must pass all the requirements passed in the options.

- `-C, --challenge <challenge>` - The [challenge][] property of the proof must
  equal this value.
- `-c, --created <created>` - The [created][] property of the proof must be on or after the given ISO8601 datetime. Defaults to the current time. 
  time.
- `-d, --domain <domain>` - The [domain][] property of the proof must equal the
  given value.
- `-p, --proof-purpose <proof-purpose>` - The [proofPurpose][] property of the proof must equal this value.
- `-v, --verification-method <verification-method>` - The [verificationMethod][]
  property of the proof must equal this value.

#### Supported proof types

- [RsaSignature2018][]
- [Ed25519VerificationKey2018][]

#### Output

The verification result output is a `VerificationResult` JSON object as specified in [vc-http-api][]:
```json
{
  "checks": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": []
}
```
Verification result properties:
- `checks` - Array of strings indicating checks completed on the credential.
- `warnings` - Array of warnings encountered during validation or verification.
- `errors` - Array of strings indicating errors encountered during validation or verification. If `errors` is empty, the credential is verified.

### `didkit vc-issue-presentation`

Issue a verifiable presentation. Reads presentation on stdin, generates proof to add to it, and outputs the resulting verifiable presentation.

Corresponds to [/credentials/prove](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/#operation/provePresentation) in [vc-http-api][].

Options are the same as for [didkit vc-issue-credential](#didkit-vc-issue-credential).

### `didkit vc-verify-presentation`

Verify a verifiable presentation. Reads verifiable presentation on stdin, and outputs verification result. Returns exit status zero if presentation successfully verified, or non-zero if errors were encountered.

Corresponds to [/presentations/verify](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/#operation/verifyPresentation) in [vc-http-api][].

Options and output format are the same as for [didkit vc-verify-credential](#didkit-vc-verify-credential).

### `didkit did-resolve <did>`

Resolve a DID to a DID document, according to [DID Resolution][did-resolution].

#### Options
- `-m, --with-metadata` - Return a the resolved DID document with resolution metadata and document metadata, in a [DID Resolution Result][did-resolution-result] object.
- `-i <name=value>` - A [DID Resolution input metadata][did-resolution-input-metadata] property. If `=` is omitted, boolean `true` is used as the value, otherwise, value is a string. May be repeated to add multiple properties. If used multiple times with the same `name`, the values are combined into an array value to form a single property.
- `-r, --did-resolver <url>` - [DID resolver HTTP(S) endpoint][did-resolution-https-binding], used for DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing for non-built-in DID Methods. Equivalent to environmental variable `DID_RESOLVER`.

#### Output
Returns the resolved DID document, optionally with metadata.

Without the `-m` option, a representation of the resolved DID document is returned, without document metadata or resolution metadata.

If the `-m` option is used, a DID Resolution Result is returned, which is a JSON object containing the following properties:
- `didDocument` - the resolved DID document
- `didResolutionMetadata` - [DID resolution metadata][did-resolution-metadata]
- `didDocumentMetadata` - [DID document metadata][did-document-metadata]
- `@context` - JSON-LD context, if using JSON-LD representation.

Exit status is zero on success, and nonzero on failure. On failure, a DID Resolution Result object may still be returned on standard output if the `-m` option is used, where the `error` property of the DID resolution metadata object is set to the error message. If `-m` is not used, the error message is returned on standnard error.

### `didkit did-dereference <did-url>`

Dereference a DID URL to a resource, as in [did-core - DID URL Dereferencing][did-url-dereferencing].

#### Options
- `-m, --with-metadata` - Return the resulting resource with resolution metadata and document metadata, in a [DID Resolution Result][did-resolution-result] object.
- `-i <name=value>` - A [DID URL Dereferencing input metadata][did-url-dereferencing-input-metadata] property. If `=` is omitted, boolean `true` is used as the value, otherwise, value is a string. May be repeated to add multiple properties. If used multiple times with the same `name`, the values are combined into an array value to form a single property.
- `-r, --did-resolver <url>` - [DID resolver HTTP(S) endpoint][did-resolution-https-binding], used for DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing for non-built-in DID Methods. Equivalent to environmental variable `DID_RESOLVER`.

#### Output
Returns the resource dereferenced from the DID URL, optionally with metadata.

Without the `-m` option, the content resulting from dereferencing is returned, without content metadata or dereferencing metadata.

If the `-m` option is used, a JSON array is returned containing the following three objects:
- The resolved DID document or other resource corresponding to the dereferenced DID URL
- [DID dereferencing metadata][did-url-dereferencing-metadata] or [DID resolution metadata][did-resolution-metadata]
- Content metadata or [DID document metadata][did-document-metadata]

Exit status is zero on success and nonzero on error. On error, if `-m` is used, the error message is returned in the `error` property of the DID dereferencing metadata object on standard output; if `-m` is not used, the error is printed on standard error.
