# Spring Boot Java Example

This project demonstrates use of verifiable credentials and presentation to enable
user authentication for an application.

## Dependencies

### Java

To run this example you will need Java 11 installed.

For example, on Ubuntu you could install OpenJDK:

```bash
# apt install openjdk-11-{jre,jdk}
```

### DIDKit

The web application makes use of DIDKit to handle credentials and presentations,
please refer to the project's documentation to build the library for your platform,
`libdidkit.so` on UNIX systems, `didkit.dll` on Windows, `libdidkit.dylib` on 
MacOS, etc.

Then you will have to add it to the classpath of your platform. On UNIX systems,
for example, you can copy (or symlink) `libdidkit.so` to `/usr/lib` or
`/usr/local/lib`.

After that you need the Java artifact (`didkit.jar`). To make things easier, this
example project has a symlink to the build directory since it lives inside the
DIDKit codebase, so all you have to do is run the following command in the root
folder to build everything.

```bash
make -C lib ../target/didkit.jar
```

If you are trying to use DIDKit with an external Java project, you will have to
point your build tool (Gradle, Maven, etc) to the `didkit.jar` file. Please refer
to those tools' documentation to find out more. Here is an excerpt of how we have
listed it on this project's `pom.xml` for Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.spruceid.didkit</groupId>
  <artifactId>didkit</artifactId>
  <version>0.1</version>
  <scope>system</scope>
  <systemPath>${basedir}/didkit.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

### Database (MySQL)

This project uses a MySQL database to store the user entity. One easy way to run
an instance is by using docker:

```bash
# docker run \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=didkit \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  --name didkit-java-db \
  -d mysql:5
```

If you need to modify the database credentials you will need to update the
relevant fields in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/didkit
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
```

### Redis

This project makes use of Redit to store single use tokens and authentication
information for the QRCode flows.

One easy way, just like MySQL, to have it running locally is to use docker:
```bash
# docker run \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  --name didkit-java-redis \
  -d redis
```

## Running

To run this example project you can execute this command from the root folder:

```bash
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can then load `http://localhost:8081` to see the web application.


To verify that DIDKit has been setup correctly, you can then run:

```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:8081/version
```

And you should expect to see a version string in the response.
