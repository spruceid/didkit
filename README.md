# DIDKit

DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier
functionality across different platforms. It was written primarily in Rust due
to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and
suitability across different platforms including embedded systems. DIDKit
embeds the [`ssi`](https://github.com/spruceid/ssi) library, which contains the
core functionality.

## Security Audits
DIDKit has undergone the following security reviews:
- [March 14th, 2022 - Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/SpruceID.pdf) | [Summary of Findings](https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-completes-first-security-audit-from-trail-of-bits/)

We are setting up a process to accept contributions. Please feel free to open
issues or PRs in the interim, but we cannot merge external changes until this
process is in place.

## Install

### Manual

DIDKit is written in [Rust][]. To get Rust, you can use [Rustup][].

Build DIDKit using [Cargo][]:
```sh
$ cargo build
```
That will give you the DIDKit CLI executable located at
`target/debug/didkit`. You can also build and install DIDKit's components separately. Building the FFI libraries will require additional dependencies. See the corresponding readmes linked below for more info.

## Usage

DIDKit can be used in any of the following ways:

- [CLI](cli/) - `didkit` command-line program
- [HTTP](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit-http/) - HTTP server (Rust library and CLI program)
- [FFI](lib/FFI.md) - libraries for C, Java, Android, and Dart/Flutter
