# DIDKit - Android

[Android Library (AAR file)][AAR] for DIDKit. The AAR file includes Java class files using [JNI][], and binary shared libraries for Android's supported architectures (x86, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86\_64). The AAR can be added to existing Android projects using Android Studio or Gradle.

## Requires

Android SDK and NDK for Linux x86\_64. The Android SDK is expected to be installed at `~/Android/Sdk`. If it is somewhere else instead, you can specify it with a Make variable, e.g. `make ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/other/location/android-sdk`

DISCLAIMER: NDK 23 is currently in beta, so it might not have all the prebuilt tools used in the build process, please stick to using a stable version, for example NDK 22.

Rust Android targets are also required. To install those with `rustup`, run:
```sh
$ make -C ../ install-rustup-android
```

The following are also required for the compilation of the vendored openssl:
- Perl; and
- Clang (to be installed with the NDK, which should be included with CMake when if you use Android Studio).

## Build and integrate

Build the `.so` libraries for each supported ABI.

Set environmental variables as needed for Gradle:

```sh
$ export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Android/sdk
```

```sh
$ make -C ../ ../target/test/android.stamp
```

Publish the android library to local maven.

```sh
$ ./gradlew :didkit:publishToMavenLocal
```

The AAR file will be built and placed at the following path:
```
./didkit/build/outputs/aar/didkit-release.aar
```

Add mavenLocal() as a repository inside your project's build.gradle

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}
```

Add didkit library as a dependency inside your app's build.gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.spruceid:didkit:0.2.1'
}
```

### Example app

Build the example app:

窶義``sh
$ ./gradlew :example:build
窶義``

The APK will be placed in the following location:
窶義``
./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
窶義``
